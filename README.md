# Melanoma-Detection-Using-ResNet50-Apache-Spark-Grad-CAM-Explainability
This project builds a deep-learning pipeline for early melanoma detection using transfer learning, distributed preprocessing with Apache Spark, and Grad-CAM explainability to evaluate model reasoning. The system is trained using the HAM10000 dermoscopic image dataset and fine-tuned to classify melanoma vs. benign lesions.
